## How it works
Type in the name of a city that you would like to see the weather, then press the search button. The wethar for the current date will appear in the main section of the browser, and five more days into the future will appear in the bottom. Your search history will populate the left side of the screen. (or top on mobile). You can select any of these past searches to review those cities again. When you refresh the page, a selction of you history will appear in the opening browser. You may choose to select one of those, or go ahead with a new search.

### Troubles Along The Way
I found implementing Bootstrap into elements thru JQuery to be a bit more challenging than I had suspected. I found that it is easier to create the elements statically in HTML first, then re-write them in JQuery. I am sure that I will be able to envision these elements without pre-writing them first with more practice.
